# Clustering-Automobile-Customers

## background
In this project I use a dataset of customers from an Automobile company. I will segement the market place into 4 distinct categories correlating with which car they would be most likley to buy. This can help marketing ensure that they are advertising the right vehicle to the right customers.

## EDA Conclusions
1. Male customers were more popular for all products. however segment D had the highest percentage and also the largest family size on average (3.23), while segment C had the highest percentage of Female customers (still only 47%).
2. Artist is the most common profession among products A, B, and C, however the dataset seems overrepresented by artists. Healthcare is the most common profession for D. product C seems common among executives indicating that it may be more of a luxury vehicle.
3. product A is mostly driven by young to middle aged adults (25-45), product B is mostly driven by people in their 40's, Product C is mostly driven by people in their 50's, Product D is mostly driven by people under 35
4. Age has the strongest correlation with spending score, and marrige has the strongest negative correlation. single people may convert better because they don't need to consult their spouses before buying a car, they may also be more likley to have two cars.

## Infrences
based on the segments I have inferred what these 4 cars may be. 
* ProductA: Crossover
* ProductB: Compact SUV
* ProductC: Sports Car
* ProductD: 4 Door Sedan

## Reccomendations
1. Reccomendation: Market product D to men with children, market product A to young people/couples without children.
2. Product A should be marketed towards professionals in the Entertainment industry and artists. Product C should be marketed towards higher income customers. Product D should be marketed towards healthcare workers with children, and more towards families in general.
3.  target older wealthy customers for product C.
